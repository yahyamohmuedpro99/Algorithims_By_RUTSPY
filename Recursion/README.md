# Recursion Basics

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself. It's a powerful concept commonly used in solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.

## Key Points about Recursion

- **Base Case and Recursive Case**: Every recursive function has two essential components:
  - The **base case**: A condition that determines when the recursion should stop. It prevents the function from infinitely calling itself.
  - The **recursive case**: The part of the function where it calls itself with modified input, typically getting closer to the base case.

- **Call Stack**: 
  - A stack is a data structure with two primary operations: push and pop.
  - In programming, function calls are managed using a call stack. Each function call is pushed onto the stack, and when a function returns, it's popped off the stack.
  - Recursion involves adding function calls onto the call stack, which can grow large as more function calls are made.

- **Memory Usage**:
  - The call stack can consume a significant amount of memory, especially with deeply nested recursive calls.
  - Large call stacks can lead to memory issues like stack overflow errors, where the stack size exceeds the available memory.

Recursion is a powerful tool, but it's essential to understand its mechanics, including the base case, recursive case, and the impact on memory usage, to use it effectively.
